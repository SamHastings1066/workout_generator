{"prompt":"I'm a runner and I would like some exercises and advice on how to keep fit while I'm injured and I can't run. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1. Pool running\nAlso known as aqua jogging, it is one of the most effective cross-training methods for runners sidelined by injury. This low-impact yet high-resistance exercise is an excellent way to engage the same group of muscles used when running. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to keep the same posture or maintain the same cadence (steps per minute) when pool running, but because it closely mimics the movement pattern of running, it provides a great cardio workout and helps maintain most of your running-specific muscles.\u201d You can purchase a running belt to keep you in an upright position and work in some drills to keep you focused. By adding in some variations like one minute maximum pace or tabata drills it can help keep you focused.\n\n2. AlterG anti-gravity treadmill\nThis space-like treadmill has revolutionised medical rehabilitation in recent years. Its unweighting technology allows injured athletes to start running again through reducing gravity\u2019s impact by selecting any weight between 20 to 100 per cent of your body weight by one per cent increments. The AlterG is the next best thing to running, without putting more stress on injured muscles or bones\u201d. A session on the AlterG isn\u2019t cheap though, with the average price being $1 per minute.\n\n3. Stair walking\nDepending on the injury, a great way to build strength and rehabilitate your body back from injury and into running again is stair walking. The plyometric motion strengthens the same muscles as lunges and squats, helps to improve balance, and taxes your lungs and heart as you power to the top.\n\n4. Walk and run\nIf you\u2019re used to going for runs that last longer than 30 minutes, but are too injured to do this, then a good alternative is to lightly jog for say five minutes and walk for 20 minutes. This ratio of running to walking depends on the severity of your injury. I recommend following an interval table to structure your return to running.\n\nIdeally you want to combine this with some body strength, stability and stretching, I call this Body Maintenance. Proper Body Maintenance will help you build a stable core and muscle strength to avoid the injury reoccurring. I recommend you try a Cross-Training Program.\n\n5. Replace one love with another\nIt might be hard to love two things equally, but try replacing running with another sport you enjoy such as swimming or cycling. The reason people run is usually because they get more of a high from running than they do from any other form of exercise.  If runners are injured then they should replace running with something that is just as enjoyable, yet still gives them a decent workout, so that it\u2019s sustainable.\n\n6. Avoid High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)\nIf you\u2019re returning from injury avoid high intensity interval training unless it\u2019s all non-impact exercise such as boxing. There are plenty of activities you can do to get your heart rate up, but the high-impact jumping, landing and sprinting that is a feature of HIIT is the worst thing you can do.\n\n7. Monitor the pain\nWhen returning to running following injury, the best guideline to keep you from going backwards in your recovery is pain. Returning to running following an injury doesn\u2019t need to be completely pain-free, but it shouldn\u2019t make an injury feel worse or create any new niggles. The last thing you want to do is stir up the pain by over training too early. When you start back running, closely monitor the pain level and if it\u2019s slight and doesn\u2019t get worse the day after, then gradually increase your training \u2013 but take it slow. \n\n8. Stop injuries before they happen\nIf you\u2019ve been injured it\u2019s worthwhile seeing a physiotherapist, podiatrist or running technique coach to help get to the bottom of why you got injured in the first place. Choose a healthcare practitioner who is actually a runner, as they will have a much better understanding of the loads and stresses involved. The single biggest factor that causes injuries in runners is doing too much too soon. The second factor is the way people run, so if you can improve the way you run you\u2019re less likely to get injured.\n\nHaving a biomechanical assessment to see how the body moves when you run can be a real eye-opener for runners. A screening helps to anticipate any potential problem areas in the body, and gives runners practical advice on how to adjust their running technique and what exercises they should be doing to reduce the likelihood of injury dashing their running dreams. ###"}
{"prompt":"Some effective exercise options while I recover from an injury \n\n###\n\n","completion":" Maintaining your cardio fitness while nursing an injury can get a little tricky, but it\u2019s not impossible. Here are some exercises you can try, depending on your injury:\n\n1. Weight Lifting and\/or Kettle Bells\nWhat? Weights? I know you\u2019re thinking this is supposed to about cardio, and it is. Promise. Lifting weights is a two-for: you can get in a cardiovascular workout and get stronger at the same time.\n\nIf you\u2019re practicing proper technique you should be able to burn some calories while keeping things relatively low impact. Obviously if you\u2019ve got a back injury, kettlebells may not be the way to go. Again it depends on your limitations.\n\n\u201cIt is possible to put together a short circuit with high repetitions, low weight, and short rest periods for a more cardiovascular result,\u201d says Dr. Luque. \u201cThe great thing is that it can be adapted to the type of injury. If there is an upper body injury, a lower body circuit would work and vice versa.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve never spent time in the weight room, you\u2019re probably going to feel a little out-of-place at first\u2014especially when you\u2019re hurt and maybe gimping around.\n\nDon\u2019t let it stop you! You\u2019re going to be surprised at the strength you\u2019ll find. Lifting weights is great for the heart, muscles, and mind.\n\n2. Ergo Meter\nAn ergo meter is the machine where you spin your arms around and around in circles. Like a pulpy green juice, it looks weird, but it\u2019s great for you.\n\nThis is an excellent choice especially for people with immobilized legs or leg injuries that prevent them from doing longer workouts like walking or biking on their feet. The only downside to ergo meters is that they\u2019re hard to find.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a standard piece of equipment in most physical therapy offices, most gyms don\u2019t have one.\n\nIf you are looking at a lengthy recovery time for a serious lower body injury, calling around to find a gym with an ergo meter might be a good idea.\n\n3. Resistance Bands\nSimilar to kettle bells or weight lifting, resistance bands work both your cardio and muscle fitness.\n\nThis is probably the cheapest and easiest workout option (recovery or not). You don\u2019t even have to go to a gym.\n\n4. Swimming\nSwimming is a difficult yet low impact workout. Most likely, if you swim consistently throughout recovery, your cardio fitness level will be better than when you first started.\n\nSwimming requires a whole body effort, making it a good challenge for those of you that usually run or bike.\n\nIf you can\u2019t stand swimming, you can try running in water or water weights.\n\n5. Biking\nCycling is great for overcoming irritating injuries. It\u2019s low impact and easy to tailor to your fitness level.\n\nThings to consider would be the choice between a recumbent and upright bike depending on the injury. For back injuries, definitely a recumbent bike.\n\n6. Walking\nIf you aren\u2019t ready for the more intense exercises, walking is a great bridge. If you can, start off your recovery process with some nice walks. \u201cI think it is one of the best ways to stay moving and keep cardio levels up,\u201d says Dr. Luque.\n\nAs you start feeling stronger, lengthen or speed up your walks, and then you can graduate to a harder exercise. ###"}

{"prompt":"I'm an intermediate level athlete. I'd like a 12 week program to help me build muscle in the gym. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" Power Hypertrophy Upper Lower (PHUL) Workout\n\nThe PHUL workout is based around the basic principles of strength and size.  This 4 day program will allow you to maximize results on both fronts in an easy adaptable routine built off the following principles:\n\nFrequency. Studies have shown muscle protein synthesis (MPS) to be elevated for up to 48 hours after training. That would make it ideal for you to hit each muscle more frequently than a typical once per week split. The PHUL program is designed to hit each muscle group twice within a week.\n\nCompounds. The PHUL program focuses on the big compound movements for optimal progression. While isolation movements are included in this program as well, the main goal is to increase performance on the main lifts, as well as pack on pounds of muscle.\n\nPower. This program uses 2 of it's 4 working days to focus on pure strength training. The key to getting stronger and bigger is to utilize progressive overload and time under tension. These 2 days will see that you'll be able to use more weight on your hypertrophy days.\n\nHypertrophy. In addition to 2 power days, your other 2 days on the PHUL program will focus on hypertrophy (bodybuilding) style training.

I have dumbells at home so I can use them \n\n###\n\n","completion":" Stuck at home and only have dumbbells? Maybe you're in a rut and what to try something different?\n\nThe dumbbell only home or gym full body workout focuses on the use of heavy compound lifts, and allows you to maximize muscle gains with minimal equipment. This workout can be run for an extended period of time. As long as you are experiencing strength and muscle gains, stick with this routine! Here are some key elements to maximizing progress:\n\nProgression. Never waste a set. Always push for more reps on every set using good form. When you can hit the top level of the recommended rep range on your first set of an exercise, add weight! This means that if an exercise calls for 3 sets of 6 to 12 reps, and on your first set you can perform 12 reps, add more weight the next time you perform this exercise.\nFailure. Do NOT train to failure. Train to the point where you believe you might fail if you attempt another rep.\nFood. You MUST eat more then it takes to maintain your bodyweight to pack on muscle mass. If you do not do this, you may add strength, but it will be very difficult to add muscle.\nA note for women: Women can perform this workout. Recommend rep range is 10 to 15 for most sets.\n\nYou will be working out 3 days per week - Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Do not add additional exercises into this workout.

These are two very effective movements if they are done properly.\n\nBarbell Hip Thrust \u2013 Make sure the barbell is in a position that you\u2019re comfortable with. If you need a towel or mat around the bar, don\u2019t be afraid to use it. The more comfortable you can be, the more beneficial the exercise is. When you lift the barbell up, make sure the glutes contract hard. Hold that position before slowly lowering the weight back down.\n\nHyperextension - This is considered by many to be a lower back exercise. If you stop when your upper body is at a 45-degree angle, then it will isolate the lower back. Raise your upper body up, and then contract the glutes so the upper body comes up even more. Your torso should be close to vertical before you lower yourself back down. If you don\u2019t have a hyperextension bench, a preacher bench or adjustable bench would work as well.\n\nThe rest of the workout includes one core movement as well as movements for the rest of the body.\n\nExercise\tSets\tReps\tRest\nBarbell Hip Thrust\t3\t8-12\t60-90 sec\nHyperextension\t3\t8-12\t60-90 sec\nDumbbell Squat\t3\t12\t60 sec\nLying Leg Raise\t3\t12\t60 sec\nPull Up\t3\t12\t60 sec\nBent-Over Barbell Row\t3\t12\t60 sec\nLateral Raise\t3\t12\t60 sec\nOverhead Triceps Extension\t3\t12\t60 sec\nPush Up\t3\t12\t60 sec\nFull-Body Workout 2\nThis one will begin with two different glute exercises.

Don\u2019t go super-heavy on it. There has never been a good morning competition, so more isn\u2019t necessarily better. If you can\u2019t handle the weight for the minimum reps, lighten the load. Wear a belt if you feel it will help protect your lower back.\n\nGlute Kickback \u2013 This is the bodyweight version of the exercise. If you have ankle weights, add them to increase resistance. If not, hold the contraction at the top for one second during the first set, two during the second set, and three for the last. \n\nThe next two movements in this program will also train the glutes in a secondary role.

Don\u2019t attempt to set the back foot further than you\u2019re capable. Do the best you can, and challenge yourself as you progress. Think about contracting the glutes when you bring the leg up.

Combine this 8 week abs workout plan with the included dieting and cardio advice, and you will help your body build and firm your abdominals while stripping away excess stomach fat.\n\nWorkout Frequency\nPerform this abs workout 2-3x a week after your resistance training sessions. It can also be performed on off training days, or with your cardio workouts.\n\nCardio\nPerform 3-4 cardio workouts per week for 20 to 30 minutes per session. Choose whichever form of cardio you prefer, from walking to sprinting to swimming to biking. The important thing to remember is that cardio should be enjoyable. If you dread performing cardio, you are more likely to miss sessions. It doesn't really matter what you are doing because you are burning calories. A flat stomach is made in the kitchen, and your diet is doing most of the work.\n\nYou may perform cardio first thing in the morning, on off days, or after your resistance training sessions.\n\nMaximizing Your Diet Plan\nSimply eating less food isn't good enough. To look fit and healthy you also need to make sure you are eating the right types of food, and not undereating. Many women undereat protein and healthy fats, and tend to end up skinny but still flabby after a period of dieting.\n\nHere are some tips that can help you maximize your diet plan, so you can look your best:\n\nCalories\nIf you're looking to lose fat, start by eating around 1800 calories per day. Your goal is to lose about 1.5 to 2 pounds of fat per week. If you lose weight more quickly than this, you also tend to lose muscle mass. The result is a skinny, but flabby body. So don't lose weight too quickly!\n\nIf you're not losing weight at this calorie level, drop your calorie intake down to 1650 for a period of no less than 2 weeks and reassess your progress.\n\nProtein\nMake sure you're eating at least 100 grams of protein per day. Protein helps you retain, repair and build muscle tissue. Many women underestimate how much protein that take in per day, so it's good to monitor this vital macronutrient.\n\nIf you have a hard time reaching a minimum of 100 grams of protein per day, consider supplementing with a protein supplement such as IsoFuel.\n\nHelpful Dieting Tips\nThere is more to a healthy diet than just calories and protein. Follow these tips to maximize your eating plan:\n\nHealthy Fats - Make sure at least 20% of your calories come from healthy fats. Healthy fats are essential for proper hormone function, brain function, fat loss and much more.\nCarbohydrates - Try to avoid the white poisons - white sugar and white flour. Instead, choose nutritious carbohydrate sources such as oatmeal, rice, quinoa, fruits and veggies.\nFlat Stomach Ab Workout for Women\nWeeks 1-4\nExercise\tSets\tReps\nCable Crunch\t2-3\t15-25\nPlank\t2-3\t30-60 Seconds\nHanging Knee Raise\t2-3\t10-20\nDumbbell Side Bends\t2-3\t10-20\nWeeks 5-8\nExercise\tSets\tReps\nTwisting Bench Crunch (Reps are per side)\t3-4\t20-30\nPlank With Feet On Bench\t3-4\t60 Seconds\nWeighted Sit Up (with dumbbell on chest)\t3-4\t20-30\nWood Chop (Reps are per side)\t3-4\t10-20 ###"}

{"prompt":"I'd like advice on how to cooling down\/ warming down, after training \n\n###\n\n","completion":" The After Training Cool Down\nStretching is not a legitimate means of cooling down. It is only part of the process. After you have completed your workout, the best way to reduce muscle fatigue and soreness (caused by the production of lactic acid from your maximal or near-maximal muscle exertion) is to perform a light warm-down. This warm-down is similar to the second half of your warm-up (but in the reverse order).\n\nThe warm-down consists of three phases:\nSport-specific activity\nDynamic stretching\nStatic stretching\nIdeally, you should start your warm-down with about 10-20 minutes of sport-specific activity (perhaps only a little more intense than in your warm-up). In reality however, you may not always have 10-20 minutes to spare at the end of your workout. You should, however, attempt to perform at least 5 minutes of sport-specific activity in this case. The sport-specific activity should immediately be followed by stretching: First perform some light dynamic stretches until your heart rate slows down to its normal rate, and then perform some static stretches. Sport-specific activity, followed by stretching, can reduce cramping, tightening, and soreness in fatigued muscles and will make you feel better.\n\nLight warm-down exercise immediately following maximal exertion is a better way of clearing lactic acid from the blood than complete rest. Furthermore, if you are still sore the next day, a light warm-up or warm-down is a good way to reduce lingering muscle tightness and soreness even when not performed immediately after a workout.\n\nQuite frequently, the progression of sensations you feel as you reach the extreme ranges of a stretch are: localized warmth of the stretched muscles, followed by a burning (or spasm-like) sensation, followed by sharp pain (or \"ouch!\" pain). The localized warming will usually occur at the origin, or point of insertion, of the stretched muscles. When you begin to feel this, it is your first clue that you may need to \"back off\" and reduce the intensity of the stretch. If you ignore (or do not feel) the warming sensation, and you proceed to the point where you feel a definite burning sensation in the stretched muscles, then you should ease up immediately and discontinue the stretch! You may not be sore yet, but you probably will be the following day. If your stretch gets to the point where you feel sharp pain, it is quite likely that the stretch has already resulted in tissue damage which may cause immediate pain and soreness that persists for several days. ###"}
{"prompt":"How should I warm up before training \n\n###\n\n","completion":" Warming up before training\n The general warm-up should begin with joint-rotations, starting either from your toes and working your way up, or from your fingers and working your way down. This facilitates joint motion by lubricating the entire joint with synovial fluid. Such lubrication permits your joints to function more easily when called upon to participate in your training activity. You should perform slow circular movements, both clockwise and counter-clockwise, until the joint seems to move smoothly. You should rotate the following (in the order given, or in the reverse order):\n\nFingers and knuckles\nWrists\nElbows\nShoulders\nNeck\nTrunk\/waist\nHips\nLegs\nKnees\nAnkles\nToes\nOnce the general warm-up has been completed, the muscles are warmer and more elastic. Immediately following your general warm-up, you should engage in some slow, relaxed, static stretching. You should start with your back, followed by your upper body and lower body, stretching your muscles in the following order:\n\nBack\nSides (external obliques)\nNeck\nForearms and wrists\nTriceps\nChest\nButtocks\nGroin (adductors)\nThighs (quadriceps and abductors)\nCalves\nShins\nHamstrings\nInstep\nSome good static stretches for these various muscles may be found in most books about stretching. Unfortunately, not everyone has the time to stretch all these muscles before a workout. If you are one such person, you should at least take the time to stretch all the muscles that will be heavily used during your workout. ###"}
{"prompt":"What are different ypes of stretching? \n\n###\n\n","completion":" The 7 different types of stretching:\nBallistic stretching\nDynamic stretching\nActive stretching\nPassive (or relaxed) stretching\nStatic stretching\nIsometric stretching\nPNF stretching\nBallistic stretching\n Ballistic stretching uses the momentum of a moving body or a limb in an attempt to force it beyond its normal range of motion. This is stretching, or \"warming up\", by bouncing into (or out of) a stretched position, using the stretched muscles as a spring which pulls you out of the stretched position. (E.g. bouncing down repeatedly to touch your toes.) This type of stretching is not considered useful and can lead to injury. It does not allow your muscles to adjust to, and relax in, the stretched position. It may instead cause them to tighten up by repeatedly activating the stretch reflex (When the muscle is stretched, so is the muscle spindle The muscle spindle records the change in length (and how fast) and sends signals to the spine which convey this information. This triggers the stretch reflex (also called the myotatic reflex) which attempts to resist the change in muscle length by causing the stretched muscle to contract. The more sudden the change in muscle length, the stronger the muscle contractions will be.)\n\nDynamic Stretching\nDynamic stretching, involves moving parts of your body and gradually increasing reach, speed of movement, or both.\" Do not confuse dynamic stretching with ballistic stretching! Dynamic stretching consists of controlled leg and arm swings that take you (gently!) to the limits of your range of motion. Ballistic stretches involve trying to force a part of the body beyond its range of motion. In dynamic stretches, there are no bounces or \"jerky\" movements. An example of dynamic stretching would be slow, controlled leg swings, arm swings, or torso twists.\n\nActive Stretching\nActive stretching is also referred to as static-active stretching. An active stretch is one where you assume a position and then hold it there with no assistance other than using the strength of your agonist muscles. An example of this would be bringing your leg up high and then holding it there without anything, (other than your leg muscles themselves) to keep the leg in that extended position. The tension of the agonists in an active stretch helps to relax the muscles being stretched (the antagonists) by reciprocal inhibition Active stretching increases active flexibility and strengthens the agonistic muscles. Active stretches are usually quite difficult to hold and maintain for more than 10 seconds and rarely need to be held any longer than 15 seconds.\n\nMany of the movements (or stretches) found in various forms of yoga are active stretches.\n\nPassive Stretching\nPassive stretching is also referred to as relaxed stretching, and as static-passive stretching. A passive stretch is one where you assume a position and hold it with some other part of your body, or with the assistance of a partner or some other apparatus. For example, bringing your leg up high and then holding it there with your hand. The splits are an example of a passive stretch (in this case the floor is the \"apparatus\" that you use to maintain your extended position). Slow, relaxed stretching is useful in relieving spasms in muscles that are healing after an injury. Obviously, you should check with your doctor first to see if it is okay to attempt to stretch the injured muscles. Relaxed stretching is also very good for \"cooling down\" after a workout and helps reduce post-workout muscle fatigue, and soreness.\n\nStatic Stretching\nStatic stretching involves holding a position. That is, you stretch to the farthest point and hold the stretch. Passive stretching is a technique in which you are relaxed and make no contribution to the range of motion. Instead, an external force is created by an outside agent, either manually or mechanically. Notice that the definition of passive stretching given in the previous section encompasses both of the above definitions. Throughout this document, when the term static stretching or passive stretching is used, its intended meaning is the definition of passive stretching as described in the previous section. You should be aware of these alternative meanings, however, when looking at other references on stretching.\n\nIsometric Stretching\nIsometric stretching is a type of static stretching (meaning it does not use motion) which involves the resistance of muscle groups through isometric contractions (tensing) of the stretched muscles. The use of isometric stretching is one of the fastest ways to develop increased static-passive flexibility and is much more effective than either passive stretching or active stretching alone. Isometric stretches also help to develop strength in the \"tensed\" muscles (which helps to develop static-active flexibility), and seems to decrease the amount of pain usually associated with stretching.\n\nThe most common ways to provide the needed resistance for an isometric stretch are to apply resistance manually to one's own limbs, to have a partner apply the resistance, or to use an apparatus such as a wall (or the floor) to provide resistance. An example of manual resistance would be holding onto the ball of your foot to keep it from flexing while you are using the muscles of your calf to try and straighten your instep so that the toes are pointed.\n\nAn example of using a partner to provide resistance, would be having a partner hold your leg up high (and keep it there) while you attempt to force your leg back down to the ground.\n\nAn example of using the wall to provide resistance would be the well known \"push-the-wall\" calf-stretch where you are actively attempting to move the wall (even though you know you can't).\n\nIsometric stretching is not recommended for children and adolescents whose bones are still growing. These people are usually already flexible enough that the strong stretches produced by the isometric contraction have a much higher risk of damaging tendons and connective tissue. It is recommended preceding any isometric stretch of a muscle with dynamic strength training for the muscle to be stretched. A full session of isometric stretching makes a lot of demands on the muscles being stretched and should not be performed more than once per day for a given group of muscles (ideally, no more than once every 36 hours).\n\nPNF stretching ###"}
