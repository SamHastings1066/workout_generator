I would like seven exercises to do while recovering from injuries,"1. Swimming & Pool Workouts
Swimming pool workouts can be a great way to exercise while being injured. Working out in the pool is low impact and fun way to burn calories.

Who doesn’t love enjoying a refreshing pool while working out? There are many different workouts that you can perform in the pool that will give you that sense of accomplishment without straining yourself. 

Typical pool workouts include:

Arms lifts 
Jumping jacks
Leg kicks
Lateral raises 
And walking
Exercising in the pool provides an opportunity for full-body workouts while limiting the impact you experience.

2. Stairs
Though not as fun as working out in the pool, walking up and downstairs is one of the best options for cardio while being injured.

Depending on the injury, stairs can be an excellent way of burning calories and keeping you on track.

The best part is you can perform this exercise anywhere – on lunch break, in between classes, or even on vacation.

3. Resistance Bands
Looking to keep the blood flowing while injured?

Resistance bands offer a way of isolating specific muscles so you can work around injuries and strengthen the muscles around injuries to ensure they won’t be lingering around. 

These bands are very inexpensive and can be used for many different exercises.

4. Stretching
If you are experiencing sprains or strains, stretching may not be the best idea for you.

However, if you are experiencing muscle tightness, stretching can help loosen those muscles and prevent further injuries.

Stretching should be a significant factor in your weekly workout schedule, as it can help keep muscles strong and flexible. 

You can also incorporate yoga into your daily routine for added benefits, just be sure to stick to basic poses to avoid further injuries.

5. Stationary Bike
Stationary bikes have come a long way in the past few years with innovative products like the Peleton bike.

If you have any upper body injuries, hopping on a stationary bike can provide a great cardio workout session without promoting injuries.

6. Balancing Exercises
Working on your balance is another essential aspect of exercise that many people overlook.

Working on balancing exercises like one leg stands can help reduce the risk of injuries while and will help the recovery process with existing injuries.

7. Walking
Walking is often overshadowed by other types of exercise. However, walking is one of the most effective ways of working out and staying in shape.

There have been several studies conducted that imply walking is the best thing to do to improve your overall health."
"I've injured my ankle and foot, but I'd still like to keep working out at the gym.","If your ankle or foot is injured, you still have many exercise options. If your doctor approves it and you are able to, try using the rowing machine, a stationary bike with one leg, or swimming. Work with your doctor or trainer to find other non-weight bearing cardio exercises you can do and spend 30 to 60 minutes about three times a week on that exercise to maintain endurance.

Circuit training is also a great choice for exercising through injuries. Here is one sample workout to try in your local gym:

Perform the following circuit workout Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
Perform each exercise for 30 to 60 seconds—allow 15 seconds of rest between stations
Complete the entire circuit three to four times
Warm-up thoroughly before exercise
Leg Extension Machine
Chest Press
Lat Pulldown
Overhead Press
Seated Cable Rows
Incline Push-Up
Ab 'Bicycle' Crunches
Hanging Leg Raise"
I'd like two circuit training routines that I can do at the gym while I have leg and knee injuries,"Leg and knee injuries can be fairly limiting for most athletes. Almost all endurance exercise requires flexion and extension of the knee joint, so developing a new routine may be frustrating. One-legged cycling, kayaking, or using an upper-body ergometer (handcycle) are options. Swimming may be possible if you use a pull buoy so you don't kick or use your legs.

Here are two circuit training routines to try:

Circuit 1:

Perform this workout Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
Perform each exercise for 30 to 60 seconds—allow 15 seconds of rest between stations
Complete the entire circuit three to four times
Warm-up thoroughly before exercise
Pull-Up or Assisted Pull-Up
Chest Press
Lat Pulldown
Overhead Press
Circuit 2:

Perform this workout on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
Perform each exercise for 30 to 60 seconds—allow 15 seconds of rest between stations
Complete the entire circuit three to four times
Warm-up thoroughly before exercise
Seated Russian Twist
Ab Crunch
V-Sit ab exercise"
I would like an exercise circuit that I can do at the gym that won't aggravate my elbow and shoulder injuries,"Shoulder or other upper body injuries often allow the most possibility for continuing traditional cardio exercise because the lower body can be exercised fully. Walking, stair climbing, stationary (hands-free) cycling, and the elliptical trainer are all possibilities.

In addition, circuit training routines will maintain strength and power in the non-injured muscles and joints. Consider performing the following circuit routine four to five times per week.

Perform each exercise for 30 to 60 seconds, unless otherwise noted—allow 15 seconds of rest between stations
Complete the entire circuit three to four times
Warm-up thoroughly before exercise
Stationary cycling for two minutes at a moderate pace and two minutes at a higher intensity
Leg Press
Elliptical trainer for two minutes at a moderate pace and two minutes at a higher intensity
Ab Crunch
Walking Lunge
Low Back Extensions
Treadmill walking for two minutes at a moderate pace and two minutes at a higher intensity (or incline)
Wall Sit"
"I would like general advice about exercising while suffering from a lower back injury, as well as a specific exercise routine that I can try at the gym that won't exacerbate my back injury","Back injuries can be difficult to recover from, so talk with your doctor about the specific type of back injury you have and your exercise limitations before you begin any alternative activities.

Walking, swimming, or recumbent cycling are generally safe for those with low back pain and this will help you maintain cardiovascular fitness as you recover.

Get your doctor or physical therapist to sign off before trying the following circuit.

Perform the following circuit workout Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
Perform each exercise for 30 to 60 seconds—allow 15 seconds of rest between stations
Complete the entire circuit three to four times
Warm-up thoroughly before exercise
Complete 30 to 60 minutes of non-weight bearing cardio on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

I'm a runner and I would like some exercises and advice on how to keep fit while I'm injured and I can't run.,"1. Pool running
Also known as aqua jogging, it is one of the most effective cross-training methods for runners sidelined by injury. This low-impact yet high-resistance exercise is an excellent way to engage the same group of muscles used when running. “It’s harder to keep the same posture or maintain the same cadence (steps per minute) when pool running, but because it closely mimics the movement pattern of running, it provides a great cardio workout and helps maintain most of your running-specific muscles.” You can purchase a running belt to keep you in an upright position and work in some drills to keep you focused. By adding in some variations like one minute maximum pace or tabata drills it can help keep you focused.

2. AlterG anti-gravity treadmill
This space-like treadmill has revolutionised medical rehabilitation in recent years. Its unweighting technology allows injured athletes to start running again through reducing gravity’s impact by selecting any weight between 20 to 100 per cent of your body weight by one per cent increments. The AlterG is the next best thing to running, without putting more stress on injured muscles or bones”. A session on the AlterG isn’t cheap though, with the average price being $1 per minute.

3. Stair walking
Depending on the injury, a great way to build strength and rehabilitate your body back from injury and into running again is stair walking. The plyometric motion strengthens the same muscles as lunges and squats, helps to improve balance, and taxes your lungs and heart as you power to the top.

4. Walk and run
If you’re used to going for runs that last longer than 30 minutes, but are too injured to do this, then a good alternative is to lightly jog for say five minutes and walk for 20 minutes. This ratio of running to walking depends on the severity of your injury. I recommend following an interval table to structure your return to running.

Ideally you want to combine this with some body strength, stability and stretching, I call this Body Maintenance. Proper Body Maintenance will help you build a stable core and muscle strength to avoid the injury reoccurring. I recommend you try a Cross-Training Program.

5. Replace one love with another
It might be hard to love two things equally, but try replacing running with another sport you enjoy such as swimming or cycling. The reason people run is usually because they get more of a high from running than they do from any other form of exercise.  If runners are injured then they should replace running with something that is just as enjoyable, yet still gives them a decent workout, so that it’s sustainable.

6. Avoid High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)
If you’re returning from injury avoid high intensity interval training unless it’s all non-impact exercise such as boxing. There are plenty of activities you can do to get your heart rate up, but the high-impact jumping, landing and sprinting that is a feature of HIIT is the worst thing you can do.

7. Monitor the pain
When returning to running following injury, the best guideline to keep you from going backwards in your recovery is pain. Returning to running following an injury doesn’t need to be completely pain-free, but it shouldn’t make an injury feel worse or create any new niggles. The last thing you want to do is stir up the pain by over training too early. When you start back running, closely monitor the pain level and if it’s slight and doesn’t get worse the day after, then gradually increase your training – but take it slow. 

8. Stop injuries before they happen
If you’ve been injured it’s worthwhile seeing a physiotherapist, podiatrist or running technique coach to help get to the bottom of why you got injured in the first place. Choose a healthcare practitioner who is actually a runner, as they will have a much better understanding of the loads and stresses involved. The single biggest factor that causes injuries in runners is doing too much too soon. The second factor is the way people run, so if you can improve the way you run you’re less likely to get injured.

Having a biomechanical assessment to see how the body moves when you run can be a real eye-opener for runners. A screening helps to anticipate any potential problem areas in the body, and gives runners practical advice on how to adjust their running technique and what exercises they should be doing to reduce the likelihood of injury dashing their running dreams."
Some effective exercise options while I recover from an injury,"Maintaining your cardio fitness while nursing an injury can get a little tricky, but it’s not impossible. Here are some exercises you can try, depending on your injury:

1. Weight Lifting and/or Kettle Bells
What? Weights? I know you’re thinking this is supposed to about cardio, and it is. Promise. Lifting weights is a two-for: you can get in a cardiovascular workout and get stronger at the same time.

If you’re practicing proper technique you should be able to burn some calories while keeping things relatively low impact. Obviously if you’ve got a back injury, kettlebells may not be the way to go. Again it depends on your limitations.

“It is possible to put together a short circuit with high repetitions, low weight, and short rest periods for a more cardiovascular result,” says Dr. Luque. “The great thing is that it can be adapted to the type of injury. If there is an upper body injury, a lower body circuit would work and vice versa.”

If you’ve never spent time in the weight room, you’re probably going to feel a little out-of-place at first—especially when you’re hurt and maybe gimping around.

Don’t let it stop you! You’re going to be surprised at the strength you’ll find. Lifting weights is great for the heart, muscles, and mind.

2. Ergo Meter
An ergo meter is the machine where you spin your arms around and around in circles. Like a pulpy green juice, it looks weird, but it’s great for you.

This is an excellent choice especially for people with immobilized legs or leg injuries that prevent them from doing longer workouts like walking or biking on their feet. The only downside to ergo meters is that they’re hard to find.

While it’s a standard piece of equipment in most physical therapy offices, most gyms don’t have one.

If you are looking at a lengthy recovery time for a serious lower body injury, calling around to find a gym with an ergo meter might be a good idea.

3. Resistance Bands
Similar to kettle bells or weight lifting, resistance bands work both your cardio and muscle fitness.

This is probably the cheapest and easiest workout option (recovery or not). You don’t even have to go to a gym.

4. Swimming
Swimming is a difficult yet low impact workout. Most likely, if you swim consistently throughout recovery, your cardio fitness level will be better than when you first started.

Swimming requires a whole body effort, making it a good challenge for those of you that usually run or bike.

If you can’t stand swimming, you can try running in water or water weights.

5. Biking
Cycling is great for overcoming irritating injuries. It’s low impact and easy to tailor to your fitness level.

Things to consider would be the choice between a recumbent and upright bike depending on the injury. For back injuries, definitely a recumbent bike.

6. Walking
If you aren’t ready for the more intense exercises, walking is a great bridge. If you can, start off your recovery process with some nice walks. “I think it is one of the best ways to stay moving and keep cardio levels up,” says Dr. Luque.

As you start feeling stronger, lengthen or speed up your walks, and then you can graduate to a harder exercise."

I'm a woman and I'm an exercise beginning. I'm looking for a training program designed to help me lose fat and transform my body by doing weight lifting. I have access to a gym.,"This 12 week program is perfect for any healthy woman who is looking to transform her body through a good weight lifting program.

The goal is to help you develop lean and functional muscle tone through foundational lifts. The workout itself targets your lower body three times a week with a strong focus on your glutes, and your upper body twice a week with a focus on sculpting the muscles of the arms.

To increase the total number of calories burned each day, we’ve also added some recommended cardio sessions that you can do either in the morning or after that day’s workout. However, if you are limited on time, they are not required to see progress with this workout.

Rest periods for this program should be kept to 30-90 seconds in between sets and exercises.

Nutrition
It is important to note that your success with any workout program depends greatly on your nutrition and sleep habits. Make sure you get 7-9 hours of sleep each night and eat enough calories to help you get the results you desire.

If your goal is to lose weight, subtract ~250 calories from this number. If you are underweight, try to add ~250 calories to this number. And if you are already at your ideal weight, make sure to eat the proper amount of calories to maintain."

The 12 Week Diet Plan
Each week will consist of 3 different types of eating days.

High Carb Days - 1 day per week
Moderate Carb Days - 3 days per week
Low Carb Days - 3 days per week
You may structure these days in any preferred manner. I suggest keeping the high carb day for special occasions. That way you can attend family functions, or eat out with friends, and indulge a little more than normal.

It should be noted that calorie intake can be adjusted based on metabolism. The follow changes are recommended:

Men 40+ - Reduce daily calories by 300.
Men 20-25 - Increase daily calories by 300.
Women 40+ - Reduce daily calories by 200.
Women 20-25 - Increase daily calories by 200.
12 Week Eating Plan for Men
Week 1 - 3 low carb days with 2300 calories, 3 moderate carbs days with 2400 calories, 1 high carb day of 2700 calories.
Week 2 - 3 low carb days with 2200 calories, 3 moderate carbs days with 2400 calories, 1 high carb day of 2700 calories.

Week 12 - 3 low carb days with 2000 calories, 3 moderate carbs days with 2200 calories, 1 high carb day of 2700 calories.
Protein intake should be a minimum of 180 grams per day. If you are a bigger guy, or have a fair amount of muscle mass, then eat 200 to 220 grams of protein per day. If you eat a little more protein the drop your daily fat intake to make up for the calories.

Fat intake should be approximately 20-30% of your daily calories. Once you have determined your daily calories from proteins and fats, fill in your eating plan with carbohydrates.

Also, you are allowed up to 10% of your daily calories from dirty foods/junk foods. You do not have to eat any junk if you prefer. This option exists as a convenience, should you be battling a craving, or attending a social gathering where you would prefer to have a small snack.

I'm an intermediate level athlete. I'd like a 12 week program to help me build muscle in the gym.,"Power Hypertrophy Upper Lower (PHUL) Workout

The PHUL workout is based around the basic principles of strength and size.  This 4 day program will allow you to maximize results on both fronts in an easy adaptable routine built off the following principles:

Frequency. Studies have shown muscle protein synthesis (MPS) to be elevated for up to 48 hours after training. That would make it ideal for you to hit each muscle more frequently than a typical once per week split. The PHUL program is designed to hit each muscle group twice within a week.

Compounds. The PHUL program focuses on the big compound movements for optimal progression. While isolation movements are included in this program as well, the main goal is to increase performance on the main lifts, as well as pack on pounds of muscle.

Power. This program uses 2 of it's 4 working days to focus on pure strength training. The key to getting stronger and bigger is to utilize progressive overload and time under tension. These 2 days will see that you'll be able to use more weight on your hypertrophy days.

Hypertrophy. In addition to 2 power days, your other 2 days on the PHUL program will focus on hypertrophy (bodybuilding) style training. This way, not only will you be seeing strength increases but you'll be building size as well.

PHUL Notes:
Sets and Reps - When first beginning this program it is suggested to start with a lower amount of total volume until you become accustomed to the workload.
Failure - Failure is a tool that should not be abused. All sets should be completed with at least 1 rep ""left in the tank."" Meaning you should struggle to complete your heavier sets, but not to the point where you're unable to get your goal reps.
Exercise Selection - Main compounds should remain unchanged, however substitutions can be made for like exercises if desired.
Abdominals - Ab work can be done at the end of training or on off days.

I'd like a 7 day muscle building workout plan designed for women beginners. I have a gym membership,"Women should lift weights. The benefits are too good not to!

No, you won’t get too bulky or too big – you just don’t have enough testosterone to get that way.

Resistance training is the only way to effectively reshape your physique by building some shapely muscle and burning some unwanted body fat at the same time.

New to this type of training or in need of something new? Below is a 7-day workout plan made just for women.

It’s actually not too far from what guys do in the gym – with lighter weights of course. It’s also a beginner’s guide taking you from basic bodyweight exercises to more traditional training so you will always be progressing and avoid being bored.

It’s time to get a little stronger, leaner and into the shape of your life!

I'm stuck at home and I'd like a full body muslce building workout I can do without access to a gym. I have dumbells at home so I can use them,"Stuck at home and only have dumbbells? Maybe you're in a rut and what to try something different?

The dumbbell only home or gym full body workout focuses on the use of heavy compound lifts, and allows you to maximize muscle gains with minimal equipment. This workout can be run for an extended period of time. As long as you are experiencing strength and muscle gains, stick with this routine! Here are some key elements to maximizing progress:

Progression. Never waste a set. Always push for more reps on every set using good form. When you can hit the top level of the recommended rep range on your first set of an exercise, add weight! This means that if an exercise calls for 3 sets of 6 to 12 reps, and on your first set you can perform 12 reps, add more weight the next time you perform this exercise.
Failure. Do NOT train to failure. Train to the point where you believe you might fail if you attempt another rep.
Food. You MUST eat more then it takes to maintain your bodyweight to pack on muscle mass. If you do not do this, you may add strength, but it will be very difficult to add muscle.
A note for women: Women can perform this workout. Recommend rep range is 10 to 15 for most sets.

You will be working out 3 days per week - Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Do not add additional exercises into this workout. Cardio can be performed first thing in the morning, or post-resistance training.

I'd like a three day glute building workout designed for owmen to get bigger butts!,"Full-Body Workout 1
The first two movements for this session are the barbell hip thrust and the hyperextension. These are two very effective movements if they are done properly.

Barbell Hip Thrust – Make sure the barbell is in a position that you’re comfortable with. If you need a towel or mat around the bar, don’t be afraid to use it. The more comfortable you can be, the more beneficial the exercise is. When you lift the barbell up, make sure the glutes contract hard. Hold that position before slowly lowering the weight back down.

Hyperextension - This is considered by many to be a lower back exercise. If you stop when your upper body is at a 45-degree angle, then it will isolate the lower back. Raise your upper body up, and then contract the glutes so the upper body comes up even more. Your torso should be close to vertical before you lower yourself back down. If you don’t have a hyperextension bench, a preacher bench or adjustable bench would work as well.

The rest of the workout includes one core movement as well as movements for the rest of the body.

Full-Body Workout 2
This one will begin with two different glute exercises. The first one is going to help you get stronger while the other will maximize the mind-muscle connection.

Good Morning – This will benefit the glutes as well as the hamstrings and lower back. Don’t go super-heavy on it. There has never been a good morning competition, so more isn’t necessarily better. If you can’t handle the weight for the minimum reps, lighten the load. Wear a belt if you feel it will help protect your lower back.

Glute Kickback – This is the bodyweight version of the exercise. If you have ankle weights, add them to increase resistance. If not, hold the contraction at the top for one second during the first set, two during the second set, and three for the last. 

The next two movements in this program will also train the glutes in a secondary role. The rest of the workout is below.

Full-Body Workout 3
The final full-body workout of the week will begin with a contraction challenge followed by an athletic version of a classic exercise. 

Bodyweight Glute Bridge - Much like planks for abs, holding a bridge will help improve stability in the glutes. If you need to start with your bodyweight alone, that is fine. If you can add a dumbbell or barbell to make the challenge more interesting, go for it.

Curtsy Lunge – If you haven’t done these before, they may appear silly. Don’t knock them until you try them. They are challenging and will be even more so after the glutes had been pre-exhausted by the bridges. Don’t attempt to set the back foot further than you’re capable. Do the best you can, and challenge yourself as you progress. Think about contracting the glutes when you bring the leg up. Concentrate hard so the hip flexors don’t dominate the set.

The next two exercises are lower-body focused. With the glutes being challenged in the first two movements, the quads and hamstrings will likely be able to work harder on their own.

I'd like a full body focused warm up,"Full-Body Focused Warm-Up
Beginners and even intermediate fitness enthusiasts can benefit from utilizing a full-body workout program. Instead of taking a top-down approach, beginning with the feet and working your way up the body will help you make the most out of the time you spend preparing.

That’s why after your brief walk, you will start working on your feet. They are what connect you to the ground, so make sure they feel good first. Then work your way up the lower body. Execute each rep or segment with control and precision. Flying through this won’t help you.

The rest periods shouldn’t be spent resting alone. Use that time to help you transition from one movement to the next. Challenge yourself to decrease the rest time between exercises. For example, if you need 45 seconds to rest during your first go-round, try to decrease that time to 40 seconds next time.

Please can I have a warm up routine for my lower body,"This is a program that could be used for some intermediate and advanced lifters that want to focus on specific portions of the body. Tag this one with any leg day program and your results will speak for themselves.

This one gets more specific to the lower body. One example is the IT Band Foam Roller exercise. If you don’t have a Foam Roller, use something like a tennis ball or med ball until you can get a roller. There are also single-leg movements and holds included. Concentrate so you can feel the stretch and contraction of the targeted area. 

Finally, there are movements for the core and shoulders. This is because they could be involved in a secondary role. Think about the squat. Your core needs to be able to stay tight and stabilize the body while you’re squatting. The shoulders are what the barbell will be on, so they should be prepared as well.

There aren’t any static holds included, but those eccentric pull-ups will be great for targeting the lats, upper back, and even the biceps. Sit-ups will challenge the core, and the jump squats will help increase the body temperature and prepare the legs for stabilizing the body during some upper body exercises.

An 8 Week Mass Building Hypertrophy Workout,"Now let’s talk about the training. This is a four-day routine. You will perform each workout once a week. The optimal way to do this would be by following this split:

Monday – Chest and Side Delts
Tuesday – Upper Back and Rear Delts
Wednesday – Off
Thursday – Arms and Abs
Friday – Legs
Saturday and Sunday – Off
That would be the best split, but let’s face facts. There are a lot of you that have jobs that don’t allow this to happen, so here’s what you need to know. Do these workouts at times that best suit you. The only rule I suggest you follow is that you don’t train for more than three days in a row before taking a day off. Two would be best, but if you must train a third consecutive day, go for it. I don’t suggest you do this normally. The recovery is vital for you to grow. Training four days in a row without the extra rest may affect the results you see from this.

I'm a female beginner exerciser. I'd like a flatter stomach. I'd like an abdominal workout designed for women,"Workout Description
It's time to get that flat stomach! Combine this 8 week abs workout plan with the included dieting and cardio advice, and you will help your body build and firm your abdominals while stripping away excess stomach fat.

Workout Frequency
Perform this abs workout 2-3x a week after your resistance training sessions. It can also be performed on off training days, or with your cardio workouts.

Cardio
Perform 3-4 cardio workouts per week for 20 to 30 minutes per session. Choose whichever form of cardio you prefer, from walking to sprinting to swimming to biking. The important thing to remember is that cardio should be enjoyable. If you dread performing cardio, you are more likely to miss sessions. It doesn't really matter what you are doing because you are burning calories. A flat stomach is made in the kitchen, and your diet is doing most of the work.

You may perform cardio first thing in the morning, on off days, or after your resistance training sessions.

Maximizing Your Diet Plan
Simply eating less food isn't good enough. To look fit and healthy you also need to make sure you are eating the right types of food, and not undereating. Many women undereat protein and healthy fats, and tend to end up skinny but still flabby after a period of dieting.

Here are some tips that can help you maximize your diet plan, so you can look your best:

Calories
If you're looking to lose fat, start by eating around 1800 calories per day. Your goal is to lose about 1.5 to 2 pounds of fat per week. If you lose weight more quickly than this, you also tend to lose muscle mass. The result is a skinny, but flabby body. So don't lose weight too quickly!

If you're not losing weight at this calorie level, drop your calorie intake down to 1650 for a period of no less than 2 weeks and reassess your progress.

Protein
Make sure you're eating at least 100 grams of protein per day. Protein helps you retain, repair and build muscle tissue. Many women underestimate how much protein that take in per day, so it's good to monitor this vital macronutrient.

If you have a hard time reaching a minimum of 100 grams of protein per day, consider supplementing with a protein supplement such as IsoFuel.

Helpful Dieting Tips
There is more to a healthy diet than just calories and protein. Follow these tips to maximize your eating plan:

Healthy Fats - Make sure at least 20% of your calories come from healthy fats. Healthy fats are essential for proper hormone function, brain function, fat loss and much more.
Carbohydrates - Try to avoid the white poisons - white sugar and white flour. Instead, choose nutritious carbohydrate sources such as oatmeal, rice, quinoa, fruits and veggies.

Bodyweight squats - Using no extra weight, feet should be slightly wider then hip width with feet pointed at a slight angle.  Push butt to the rear as if sitting in a chair,  keep chest and face up to maintain correct position. Try to squat low enough so thighs are parallel to the floor.
Leg lifts - Lie on floor and lift both straight legs or modify w/bent knees.
Knee extensions - Seated on floor, lean back on hands, draw knees toward chest, then extend to straight leg.  Keep legs off the floor!  Modify if needed by working one leg at a time.
Hands up push up - Starting position is chest on floor, place hands in push up position lift yourself up to a push up, return to starting position and lift hands off floor for each rep)
Burpees - From standing position place hands on floor, kick both legs out behind you, drop chest to floor, push up and jump feet back in, stand and jump off floor and clap hands, this is one rep.  If you need to modify you can walk legs back one at a time, keep chest off floor and skip the jump at the end.

"I'd like advice on how to cooling down/ warming down, after training","The After Training Cool Down
Stretching is not a legitimate means of cooling down. It is only part of the process. After you have completed your workout, the best way to reduce muscle fatigue and soreness (caused by the production of lactic acid from your maximal or near-maximal muscle exertion) is to perform a light warm-down. This warm-down is similar to the second half of your warm-up (but in the reverse order).

The warm-down consists of three phases:
Sport-specific activity
Dynamic stretching
Static stretching
Ideally, you should start your warm-down with about 10-20 minutes of sport-specific activity (perhaps only a little more intense than in your warm-up). In reality however, you may not always have 10-20 minutes to spare at the end of your workout. You should, however, attempt to perform at least 5 minutes of sport-specific activity in this case. The sport-specific activity should immediately be followed by stretching: First perform some light dynamic stretches until your heart rate slows down to its normal rate, and then perform some static stretches. Sport-specific activity, followed by stretching, can reduce cramping, tightening, and soreness in fatigued muscles and will make you feel better.

Light warm-down exercise immediately following maximal exertion is a better way of clearing lactic acid from the blood than complete rest. Furthermore, if you are still sore the next day, a light warm-up or warm-down is a good way to reduce lingering muscle tightness and soreness even when not performed immediately after a workout.

Quite frequently, the progression of sensations you feel as you reach the extreme ranges of a stretch are: localized warmth of the stretched muscles, followed by a burning (or spasm-like) sensation, followed by sharp pain (or ""ouch!"" pain). The localized warming will usually occur at the origin, or point of insertion, of the stretched muscles. When you begin to feel this, it is your first clue that you may need to ""back off"" and reduce the intensity of the stretch. If you ignore (or do not feel) the warming sensation, and you proceed to the point where you feel a definite burning sensation in the stretched muscles, then you should ease up immediately and discontinue the stretch! You may not be sore yet, but you probably will be the following day. If your stretch gets to the point where you feel sharp pain, it is quite likely that the stretch has already resulted in tissue damage which may cause immediate pain and soreness that persists for several days."
How should I warm up before training,"Warming up before training
 The general warm-up should begin with joint-rotations, starting either from your toes and working your way up, or from your fingers and working your way down. This facilitates joint motion by lubricating the entire joint with synovial fluid. Such lubrication permits your joints to function more easily when called upon to participate in your training activity. You should perform slow circular movements, both clockwise and counter-clockwise, until the joint seems to move smoothly. You should rotate the following (in the order given, or in the reverse order):

Fingers and knuckles
Wrists
Elbows
Shoulders
Neck
Trunk/waist
Hips
Legs
Knees
Ankles
Toes
Once the general warm-up has been completed, the muscles are warmer and more elastic. Immediately following your general warm-up, you should engage in some slow, relaxed, static stretching. You should start with your back, followed by your upper body and lower body, stretching your muscles in the following order:

Back
Sides (external obliques)
Neck
Forearms and wrists
Triceps
Chest
Buttocks
Groin (adductors)
Thighs (quadriceps and abductors)
Calves
Shins
Hamstrings
Instep
Some good static stretches for these various muscles may be found in most books about stretching. Unfortunately, not everyone has the time to stretch all these muscles before a workout. If you are one such person, you should at least take the time to stretch all the muscles that will be heavily used during your workout."
What are different ypes of stretching?,"The 7 different types of stretching:
Ballistic stretching
Dynamic stretching
Active stretching
Passive (or relaxed) stretching
Static stretching
Isometric stretching
PNF stretching
Ballistic stretching
 Ballistic stretching uses the momentum of a moving body or a limb in an attempt to force it beyond its normal range of motion. This is stretching, or ""warming up"", by bouncing into (or out of) a stretched position, using the stretched muscles as a spring which pulls you out of the stretched position. (E.g. bouncing down repeatedly to touch your toes.) This type of stretching is not considered useful and can lead to injury. It does not allow your muscles to adjust to, and relax in, the stretched position. It may instead cause them to tighten up by repeatedly activating the stretch reflex (When the muscle is stretched, so is the muscle spindle The muscle spindle records the change in length (and how fast) and sends signals to the spine which convey this information. This triggers the stretch reflex (also called the myotatic reflex) which attempts to resist the change in muscle length by causing the stretched muscle to contract. The more sudden the change in muscle length, the stronger the muscle contractions will be.)

Dynamic Stretching
Dynamic stretching, involves moving parts of your body and gradually increasing reach, speed of movement, or both."" Do not confuse dynamic stretching with ballistic stretching! Dynamic stretching consists of controlled leg and arm swings that take you (gently!) to the limits of your range of motion. Ballistic stretches involve trying to force a part of the body beyond its range of motion. In dynamic stretches, there are no bounces or ""jerky"" movements. An example of dynamic stretching would be slow, controlled leg swings, arm swings, or torso twists.

Active Stretching
Active stretching is also referred to as static-active stretching. An active stretch is one where you assume a position and then hold it there with no assistance other than using the strength of your agonist muscles. An example of this would be bringing your leg up high and then holding it there without anything, (other than your leg muscles themselves) to keep the leg in that extended position. The tension of the agonists in an active stretch helps to relax the muscles being stretched (the antagonists) by reciprocal inhibition Active stretching increases active flexibility and strengthens the agonistic muscles. Active stretches are usually quite difficult to hold and maintain for more than 10 seconds and rarely need to be held any longer than 15 seconds.

Many of the movements (or stretches) found in various forms of yoga are active stretches.

Passive Stretching
Passive stretching is also referred to as relaxed stretching, and as static-passive stretching. A passive stretch is one where you assume a position and hold it with some other part of your body, or with the assistance of a partner or some other apparatus. For example, bringing your leg up high and then holding it there with your hand. The splits are an example of a passive stretch (in this case the floor is the ""apparatus"" that you use to maintain your extended position). Slow, relaxed stretching is useful in relieving spasms in muscles that are healing after an injury. Obviously, you should check with your doctor first to see if it is okay to attempt to stretch the injured muscles. Relaxed stretching is also very good for ""cooling down"" after a workout and helps reduce post-workout muscle fatigue, and soreness.

Static Stretching
Static stretching involves holding a position. That is, you stretch to the farthest point and hold the stretch. Passive stretching is a technique in which you are relaxed and make no contribution to the range of motion. Instead, an external force is created by an outside agent, either manually or mechanically. Notice that the definition of passive stretching given in the previous section encompasses both of the above definitions. Throughout this document, when the term static stretching or passive stretching is used, its intended meaning is the definition of passive stretching as described in the previous section. You should be aware of these alternative meanings, however, when looking at other references on stretching.

Isometric Stretching
Isometric stretching is a type of static stretching (meaning it does not use motion) which involves the resistance of muscle groups through isometric contractions (tensing) of the stretched muscles. The use of isometric stretching is one of the fastest ways to develop increased static-passive flexibility and is much more effective than either passive stretching or active stretching alone. Isometric stretches also help to develop strength in the ""tensed"" muscles (which helps to develop static-active flexibility), and seems to decrease the amount of pain usually associated with stretching.

The most common ways to provide the needed resistance for an isometric stretch are to apply resistance manually to one's own limbs, to have a partner apply the resistance, or to use an apparatus such as a wall (or the floor) to provide resistance. An example of manual resistance would be holding onto the ball of your foot to keep it from flexing while you are using the muscles of your calf to try and straighten your instep so that the toes are pointed.

An example of using a partner to provide resistance, would be having a partner hold your leg up high (and keep it there) while you attempt to force your leg back down to the ground.

An example of using the wall to provide resistance would be the well known ""push-the-wall"" calf-stretch where you are actively attempting to move the wall (even though you know you can't).

Isometric stretching is not recommended for children and adolescents whose bones are still growing. These people are usually already flexible enough that the strong stretches produced by the isometric contraction have a much higher risk of damaging tendons and connective tissue. It is recommended preceding any isometric stretch of a muscle with dynamic strength training for the muscle to be stretched. A full session of isometric stretching makes a lot of demands on the muscles being stretched and should not be performed more than once per day for a given group of muscles (ideally, no more than once every 36 hours).
