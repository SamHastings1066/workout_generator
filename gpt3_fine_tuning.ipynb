       "\"Full-Body Workout 1\\nThe first two movements for this session are the barbell hip thrust and the hyperextension. These are two very effective movements if they are done properly.\\n\\nBarbell Hip Thrust â€“ Make sure the barbell is in a position that youâ€™re comfortable with. If you need a towel or mat around the bar, donâ€™t be afraid to use it. The more comfortable you can be, the more beneficial the exercise is. When you lift the barbell up, make sure the glutes contract hard. Hold that position before slowly lowering the weight back down.\\n\\nHyperextension - This is considered by many to be a lower back exercise. If you stop when your upper body is at a 45-degree angle, then it will isolate the lower back. Raise your upper body up, and then contract the glutes so the upper body comes up even more. Your torso should be close to vertical before you lower yourself back down. If you donâ€™t have a hyperextension bench, a preacher bench or adjustable bench would work as well.\\n\\nThe rest of the workout includes one core movement as well as movements for the rest of the body.\\n\\nExercise\\tSets\\tReps\\tRest\\nBarbell Hip Thrust\\t3\\t8-12\\t60-90 sec\\nHyperextension\\t3\\t8-12\\t60-90 sec\\nDumbbell Squat\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nLying Leg Raise\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nPull Up\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nBent-Over Barbell Row\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nLateral Raise\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nOverhead Triceps Extension\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nPush Up\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nFull-Body Workout 2\\nThis one will begin with two different glute exercises. The first one is going to help you get stronger while the other will maximize the mind-muscle connection.\\n\\nGood Morning â€“ This will benefit the glutes as well as the hamstrings and lower back. Donâ€™t go super-heavy on it. There has never been a good morning competition, so more isnâ€™t necessarily better. If you canâ€™t handle the weight for the minimum reps, lighten the load. Wear a belt if you feel it will help protect your lower back.\\n\\nGlute Kickback â€“ This is the bodyweight version of the exercise. If you have ankle weights, add them to increase resistance. If not, hold the contraction at the top for one second during the first set, two during the second set, and three for the last. \\n\\nThe next two movements in this program will also train the glutes in a secondary role. The rest of the workout is below.\\n\\nExercise\\tSets\\tReps\\tRest\\nGood Morning\\t3\\t8-12\\t60-90 sec\\nGlute Kick Back\\t3\\t8-12\\t60-90 sec\\nStiff Leg Deadlift\\t3\\t8-12\\t60-90 sec\\nGoblet Squat\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nCrunches\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nIncline Dumbbell Press\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nDumbbell Flys\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nDumbbell Tricep Kickbacks\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nPullover\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nSeated Dumbbell Curl\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nFull-Body Workout 3\\nThe final full-body workout of the week will begin with a contraction challenge followed by an athletic version of a classic exercise. \\n\\nBodyweight Glute Bridge - Much like planks for abs, holding a bridge will help improve stability in the glutes. If you need to start with your bodyweight alone, that is fine. If you can add a dumbbell or barbell to make the challenge more interesting, go for it.\\n\\nCurtsy Lunge â€“ If you havenâ€™t done these before, they may appear silly. Donâ€™t knock them until you try them. They are challenging and will be even more so after the glutes had been pre-exhausted by the bridges. Donâ€™t attempt to set the back foot further than youâ€™re capable. Do the best you can, and challenge yourself as you progress. Think about contracting the glutes when you bring the leg up. Concentrate hard so the hip flexors donâ€™t dominate the set.\\n\\nThe next two exercises are lower-body focused. With the glutes being challenged in the first two movements, the quads and hamstrings will likely be able to work harder on their own.\\n\\nExercise\\tSets\\tReps\\tRest\\nBodyweight Glute Bridge\\t3\\t15-30 sec\\t60-90 sec\\nCurtsy Lunge\\t3\\t12\\t60-90 sec\\nJump Squat\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nWalking Lunge\\t3\\t12, each leg\\t60 sec\\nSide Crunch\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nSeated Dumbbell Press\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nRear Lateral Raise\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nLying Tricep Extension\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nFlat Dumbbell Fly\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nT-Bar Row (or Two-Arm DB Row)\\t3\\t12\\t60 sec\\nAccessory Workout 1\\nExercise\\tSets\\tReps\\tRest\\nBodyweight Glute Bridge\\t5\\t20\\t30 sec\\nBodyweight Hip Thrust\\t5-10\\t100 total reps\\tAs needed*\\n*Perform as many reps as you can.
